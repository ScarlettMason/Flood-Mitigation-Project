# Using Flood Excess Volume to Assess the 2009 and 2015 Cumbria Floods

This project investigates the devastating 2009 and 2015 flood events in Cumbria, UK, using the concept of **Flood Excess Volume (FEV)**. It evaluates and compares the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of various flood mitigation strategies — including reservoirs, flood walls, tree planting, peatland and floodplain restoration — to inform decision-making by policymakers and the public. Our findings suggest that while nature-based solutions like tree planting and floodplain restoration offer environmental benefits, they contribute relatively little to flood volume reduction. In contrast, infrastructure-based solutions like reservoir drawdown and urban flood walls provide greater mitigation capacity but at a higher cost and with downstream conflicts. Key recommendations include combining strategies to balance environmental co-benefits with reliable flood protection. Investments should prioritise adaptive strategies with proven volumetric impact, supported by improved forecasting and data sharing across agencies.


## Project Objectives

- Calculate FEV for the 2009 and 2015 flood events using real hydrological data.
- Assess the effectiveness of existing and hypothetical flood mitigation strategies.
- Communicate flood risks and mitigation outcomes through accessible visualisation tools.
- Provide cost-benefit insights to aid policymaking in flood management.

## Tools & Technologies

- Python (NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Hydrology Data from the Environment Agency
- Google Earth & Maps (for spatial context)
- Report typeset using LaTeX (MATH3001 template)

## Key Results

- FEV for 2015 flood: ~12 million m³; 2009: ~13.2 million m³
- Flood walls and reservoirs provide high-volume mitigation but come with high costs
- Tree planting and peatland restoration offer long-term ecological benefits and moderate FEV mitigation
- Visualised FEV as a 2m-deep “square lake” to help stakeholders grasp volume and effectiveness
